== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there some demo I can checkout? I want to see how the plugin appears on the front end of a WordPress site before I install it. =

Yes! Check out the demo we've set up on our site, which shows off some of the features of the pro version.

<a href="https://www.wp-timelineexpress.com/examples/basic-timeline/" title="View the demo">View the Timeline Express Demo</a>

= Can I filter announcements by categories/Can I create multiple timelines? =
Not in the free version, but with our pro version you can create numerous timelines and assign posts to a single timeline or all timelines. Also with the pro version you can easily filter announcements by categories on the front end.

<a href="https://www.wp-timelineexpress.com/examples/filterable-timeline/" title="View the demo">View the Timeline Express Pro Demo</a>

= How do I use this plugin? =
Begin by simply installing the plugin. Once the plugin has been installed, go ahead and begin creating announcement posts. You'll find a new menu item just below 'Posts'.
After you have a substantial number of announcements set up, you're ready to display the timeline on the front end of your site.

Timeline Express displays best on full width pages, but is not limited to them. Create a new page, and drop the shortcode into the page - `[timeline-express]`.
Publish your page, and view it on the front end the see your new super sweet timeline! (scroll for animation effects!)

= What template is the single announcement post using? Can I customize it at all? I want to do x, y or z. =
Yes! In version 1.2 and above, we have a templating engine built into the plugin - allowing you to fully customize both the announcement containers on the timeline or the single announcement page. All you have to do is copy over the proper templates.

Take a look at our documentation articles on <a href="https://www.wp-timelineexpress.com/documentation/customize-announcement-container/">customizations</a>.

= Why can't I save dates prior to '1970'? =
Due to a limitation with the built in php function `strtotime()`, you may not be able to save dates prior to 1970. We've built out a premium add-on that works with both the free and pro versions of Timeline Express to allow dates to be saved between the years 1000-9999. If this is a feature you need, please consider purchasing the <strong><a href="https://www.evan-herman.com/wordpress-plugin/timeline-express-historical-dates-add-on/">Historical Dates Add-On</a></strong>.

= Can I create more than one timeline? =
The free version limits you to one timeline. With the <a href="http://www.evan-herman.com/wordpress-plugin/timeline-express/" title="Timeline Express Pro">pro version</a>, you can create unlimited number of timelines and even assign categories to your announcements.

= Can I assign categories to my announcements? =
You can assign categories and filter your timelines by category with the <a href="http://www.evan-herman.com/wordpress-plugin/timeline-express/" title="Timeline Express Pro">pro version</a> only.

= At what width are the breakpoints set? =
Breakpoints are set at 822px. The timeline will shift/re-adjust automatically based on the height of each announcement container.

= How can I translate this plugin? =
The text-domain for all gettext functions is `timeline-express`.

If you enjoy this plugin and want to contribute, we are always looking for people to help translate the plugin into their native language. Anyone who translates this plugin to 100% completion, will receive a single site license for Timeline Express Pro, valid for 1 full calendar year.

If you need help getting started, read through Codex article "[GlotPress]"(https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/) for more information.

<strong>Developer Documentation</strong>

**Hooks + Filters**

**Use Custom Images Instead of Font Awesome Icons (New v1.1.6.7)**

Users can now use the custom announcement image in place of the font awesome icons by using the following filter. Huge thanks to <a href="https://petenelson.com/">Pete Nelson</a> for the pull request and making this possible and available for everyone.

Filter - timeline-express-custom-icon-html

Usage Example: https://gist.github.com/EvanHerman/6bbc8de82f34b4cb3c5c

**Use Alternate Image Size For Announcements (New v1.1.5.5)**

By default Timeline Express generates a custom image size to use within the timeline. If you would like to use another image size, you can use the following filter.

Example:
<code>
function change_timeline_express_announcement_image_size( $image_size ) {
	$image_size = 'full';
	return $image_size;
}
add_filter( 'timeline-express-announcement-img-size' , 'change_timeline_express_announcement_image_size' );
</code>

**Define your own custom fields to use in Announcement posts (New v1.1.5)**

Users can now add custom fields to Timeline Express announcement posts. This allows for greater control over the announcements and the front end display. Using this hook in conjunction with a custom single announcement template will give you the greatest control.

Example:
<code>
function add_custom_timeline_express_field( $custom_fields ) {
	$custom_fields = array(
		array(
			'name' => __( 'Example Text Field', 'timeline-express' ),
			'desc' => __( 'this is an example user defined text field.', 'timeline-express' ),
			'id'   => 'announcement_user_defined_text',
			'type' => 'text_medium',
		),
		array(
			'name' => __( 'Example WYSIWYG', 'timeline-express' ),
			'desc' => __( 'this is an example wysiwyg field.', 'timeline-express' ),
			'id'   => 'announcement_user_defined_wysiwyg',
			'type' => 'wysiwyg',
		),
		array(
			'name' => __( 'Example Email Field', 'timeline-express' ),
			'desc' => __( 'this is an example user defined email field.', 'timeline-express' ),
			'id'   => 'announcement_user_defined_money',
			'type' => 'text_email',
		)
	);
	return $custom_fields;
}
add_filter( 'timeline_express_custom_fields' , 'add_custom_timeline_express_field' );
</code>

This example would add 3 new fields below the 'Announcement Image' field on the announcement post.

The first field is a simple text field. The second field is an example WYSIWYG, and the third is an email field.

Note: You can add as many fields as you would like, and display them on the front end using the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_post_meta" target="_blank" title="WordPress Codex: get_post_meta()">get_post_meta()</a> function.

**Customize the 'announcement' slug (New v1.1.4)**

Users can now define their own slug for announcement posts using the provided filter `'timeline-express-slug'`. This alters the URL structure of the announcement, possibly for SEO purposes. You would enter the following code into your active themes functions.php file.

After you enter the code into the functions.php file, you'll want to refresh your permalinks. You can do so by going to 'Settings > Permalinks' and simply clicking save. That will prevent the 404 page you may see upon altering the slug.

Example:
<code>
// alter '/announcement/' to be '/event/'
function timeline_express_change_announcement_slug( $slug ) {
    $slug = 'event';
    return $slug;
}
add_filter('timeline-express-slug', 'timeline_express_change_announcement_slug' );
</code>

This example would change the default `/announcement/` slug, to `/event/`.

**Alter the 'Read More' button text (New v1.1.3.1)**

Users can now alter the 'Read More' button text using the provided gettext filter and the 'timeline-express' text domain.

Example:
<code>
// alter 'Read more' to say 'View Announcement'
function timeline_express_change_readmore_text( $translated_text, $untranslated_text, $domain ) {
    switch( $untranslated_text ) {
        case 'Read more':
          $translated_text = __( 'View Announcement','timeline-express' );
        break;
     }
   return $translated_text;
}
add_filter('gettext', 'timeline_express_change_readmore_text', 20, 3);
</code>

This example would alter 'Read more' to say 'View Announcement'.

**Add custom classes to the 'Read More' button (New v1.1.3.1)**

Users can now add custom classes to the 'Read More' announcement button. This allows for greater control in fitting the Timeline into your currently active theme.

Parameters :

$button_classes = default button classes assigned to the 'Read More' button

Example:
<code>
// add a custom class to the Timeline Express readmore link
function timeline_express_custom_readmore_class( $button_classes ) {
	return $button_classes . 'custom-class-name';
}
add_filter( 'timeline-express-read-more-class' , 'timeline_express_custom_readmore_class' );
</code>

This example would print the following 'Read More' button HTML onto the page :

`<a href="http://site.com/link-to-announcement" class="cd-read-more btn btn-primary custom-class-name">Read more</a>`

**Setup a custom date format for front end display (New v1.0.9)**

New in version 1.0.9 is the localization of dates on the front end. The date format is now controlled by your date settings inside of 'General > Settings'.

If, for one reason or another, you'd like to specify a different date format than provided by WordPress core you can use the provided filter `timeline_express_custom_date_format`.

The one parameter you need to pass into your function is $date_format, which is (as it sounds) the format of the date.

Some formatting examples:

* `m.d.Y` - 11.19.2014
* `d-m-y` - 11-19-14
* `d M y` - 19 Nov 2014
* `D j/n/Y` - Wed 11/19/2014
* `l jS \of\ F` - Wednesday 19th of November

Example:
<code>
function custom_te_date_format( $date_format ) {
	$date_format = "M d , Y"; // will print the date as Nov 19 , 2014
	return $date_format;
}
add_filter( 'timeline_express_custom_date_format' , 'custom_te_date_format' , 10 );
</code>

* d - Numeric representation of a day, with leading zeros 01 through 31.
* m - Numeric representation of a month, with leading zeros 01 through 12.
* y - Numeric representation of a year, two digits.

* D - Textual representation of a day, three letters Mon through Sun.
* j - Numeric representation of a day, without leading zeros 1 through 31.
* n - Numeric representation of a month, without leading zeros 1 through 12.
* Y - Numeric representation of a year, four digits.

* S - English ordinal suffix for the day of the month. Consist of 2 characters st, nd, rd or th.
* F - Textual representation of a month, January through December.

* M - Textual representation of a month, three letters Jan through Dec.


<em>[view more date formatting parameters](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php)</em>


**Load Your Own Single Announcement Template File (New v1.0.8)**

By default all single announcements will try and load a single.php template file. If that can't be found, we've done our best to implement a template for you. If your unhappy with the template file we've provided you have two options. Your first option is to copy over the single-announcement-template directory contained within the plugin into your active themes root. This will trigger the plugin to load that file instead. You can then customize this file to your hearts content without fear of losing any of your changes in the next update.

Your next option is to use our new filter for loading your own custom template file. If for whatever reason you've designed or developed your own single.php file which you would rather use, or you just want to use your themes page.php template instead, you can use the provided filter to change the loaded template. Here is an example ( you want to drop this code into your active theme's functions.php file ) :

Example:
<code>
// By default Timeline Express uses single.php for announcements
// you can load page.php instead
// just change page.php to whatever your template file is named
// keep in mind, this is looking in your active themes root for the template
function custom_timeline_express_template_file( $template_file ) {
	$template_file = 'page.php';
	return $template_file;
}
add_filter( 'timeline_express_custom_template' , 'custom_timeline_express_template_file' , 10 );
</code>

**Specify Font Awesome Version (New 1.1.7.8)**

Users can now specify which version of font awesome to load from the font awesome CDN. Alternatively, if the font awesome version is not found - the bundled fall back (version 4.6.1) will be used.

Example:
<code>
// use a different version of Font Awesome
function timeline_express_alter_font_awesome_version( $version ) {
	$version = '4.4.0';
	return $version;
}
add_filter( 'timeline_express_font_awesome_version', 'timeline_express_alter_font_awesome_version' );
</code>

The above example will load font awesome version 4.4.0 instead of the current stable version from the font awesome CDN.
